Bayesian statistics provide the necessary mathematical language to quantify the OODA loop. It not only serves as the enginnering framework of physical sensing and control, but also as the theoretic framework for understanding cooperative and competing actors in a multi-agent system. (i.e., Instead of merely estimating the x, y, and z spational coordinates of an object for tracking and sensing purposes, estimating belief state vectors with many more dimensions representing both physical and abstract parameters.) This project is my attempt to better understand the mathematics of recursive Bayesian estimation in order to design and create systems that automate decision-making beyong human capabilties. 

I want to primarily explore this topic from an information-theoretic lens: How does the entropy of model beliefs change depending on the entropy of the observations? How does relate to the necessary data rate required for communications between cooperative actors? Secondarily are the practical considerations: How does the computational demand of a filter scale with dimensions of the state space? How to get around having to explicitly define state parameters from observations? Variational autoencoders?

I begin with implementing two commonly used examples of recursive Bayesian estimation: the Kalman filter and the particle filter.
